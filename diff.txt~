Function calls in python3 require explicit conversion of arguments. eg:from inputted string to int
Looping through the lists in python3 each time is in random order
whereas in python,it is in the same order
isdecimal() is not present for string in python2
os.listdir() takes 1 argument in python2,whereas in python3,without any argument ,lists the files in current working directory
